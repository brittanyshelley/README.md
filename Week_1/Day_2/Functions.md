```javascript
const person = "Martha";

// BAD
const sayHelloBadly = function() {
  console.log(`Howdy, ${person}`);
}
sayHelloBadly(); // Works, but not ideal!

// GOOD
const sayHelloGoodly = function(name) {
  console.log(`Howdy, ${name}`);
}
sayHelloGoodly(person);
```
## Here are all 5 rules reviewed below:

1. Give your functions precise verb/action based names
2. Use camelCasedNames (like this one)
3. Properly indent the function code
4. Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things
    * One single task could be to compute and return a value (eg: zeroPad)
    * Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as logging a message to the screen (eg: printFarmInventory)
5. Data needed by Functions should be passed in as parameters/arguments (i.e. local scope) instead of being accessed directly
