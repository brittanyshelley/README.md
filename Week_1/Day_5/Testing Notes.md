## Test Tips
How to Approach test:

Many of the questions reference functions we wrote on previous questions on the test: 
Therefore  utilize callback functions to streamline the process, instead of recoding the function.
If you recognize question on the test that are similar to questions done in the weeks work you are allowed to reference the code that you’ve already written.
For larger math problems such as stdev. Instead of trying to understand the math behind it, break down the individual parts of the formula. For example:

```javascript
stdev = sqrt(sum((x - populationMean)^2)/numberOfValues)
 *
```

For (sum) in the equation you can use mocha to implement the sum formula you created earlier on.

Lastly, this was the longest test we have. The rest of them will be shorter, so don’t worry if you weren’t capable of finish the mock test during the allocated time.
